The Internet ## Things (IoT) universe will continue to expand with the advent ## the sixth generation ## mobile networks (6G), which is expected to support applications ** services with higher data rates, ultra-reliability, ** lower latency compared to the fifth generation ## mobile networks (5G). These new demanding 6G applications will introduce heavy load ** strict performance requirements on the network. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a %% approach to handling these challenging requirements, but it also poses significant Resource Allocation (RA) challenges. Especially since 6G network services will be highly complicated ** comparatively short lived, network operators will be compelled to deploy these services in a flexible, on-demand, ** agile manner. To address the aforementioned issues, microservice approaches are being investigated, in which the services are decomposed ** loosely coupled, resulting in increased deployment flexibility ** modularity.
